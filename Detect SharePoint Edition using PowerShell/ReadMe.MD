**Note**

- The SharePoint Foundation 2013 is a subset of SharePoint Server 2013 so that if you have SharePoint Server (Standard / Enterprise) Edition, the SharePoint Foundation by default will be listed plus the current SharePoint Edition.
- There is no SharePoint Foundation for SharePoint 2016 so that the script will show specifically which SharePoint 2016 (Standard / Enterprise) Edition has been installed. See also [SharePoint 2016 Foundation, What's the alternative?](https://spgeeks.devoworx.com/sharepoint-foundation-2016-whats-the-alternative/)
